# LLA 

This repo store projects from Low Level Academy 

I learned C this year, but the thing is it's very hard now to learn 
languages with the temptation of using AI to do the work for you.
So I just did LLA as a course to learn, without the help of AI, how at least 
one real C programmer does it.
