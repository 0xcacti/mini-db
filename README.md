# Mini DB 

This is a miniature implementation of a database. 
It's very very mini obviously, I did it by following low level learning's 
C course online.  I was learning C all on my lonesome and by using 
ai to help me out, and the thing is I felt like I wasn't really learning 
deeply.  I didn't know idiomatic C, I was just writing code that "worked", 
but did it work? So that's the purpose of this project.  I like to 
reuse git repos, so this may be repurposed in the future. I mean, 
it already has been repurposed for this project.
